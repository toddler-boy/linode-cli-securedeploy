## Super Simple Terminal prompts for using the Linode CLI!

This is a really lightweight prompt for using the Linode CLI to deploy a Linode using the *Secure Your Server* Marketplace Application.  

The script will allow you to manually input your plan-size, region, and distro (*This Marketplace App utilizes Debian 10, Debian 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS only*)

Using this script obviously has a few requisites to make this work. You are going to need:

- [ALinode account](https://login.linode.com)
Create your account - Linode Loginhttps://login.linode.com â€º signup)
- [The Linode-CLI](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/guides/install/)  installed on your local machine (*or VM*).
- Money to pay for any stuff you create.  ***This is going to create live services so make sure you [delete them](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/stop-billing/) if you don't want them.***
